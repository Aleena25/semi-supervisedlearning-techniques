# semi-supervisedlearning-techniques
Supervised and unsupervised learning are the two main approaches to machine
learning. Supervised learning uses complete labeled examples for training
and unsupervised learning uses unlabeled examples for training. Semi-supervised
learning is another learning technique which uses both labeled and unlabeled examples
for training . In the real world strategy the availability of unlabeled examples
is abundant whereas the availability of labeled examples is few. The project aims
to implement and compare the performance of different semi-supervised learning
techniques for pattern classification where the labeled examples are sparsely available.
The project focuses on three different approaches: semi-supervised support
vector machine (S3VM) which is an extension of supervised method support vector
machines(SVM), k-NN classifier using self-training and label propagation. S3VM
is compared with two different approaches in SVM, and the performances of the
three semi-supervised learning techniques are compared and evaluated using twoclass
data-sets. For multi-class data-sets one-against approach is used in S3VM
and SVMâ€™s. Label propagation method shows superior performance than the two
semi-supervised techniques implemented.
